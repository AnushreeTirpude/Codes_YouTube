This means first that it is consistent.It was in Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs that the point was made: \"Programs must be written for people to read and only incidentally for machines to execute.\" Machines do not care about beauty, but people do. Of course, not every script needs to be beautiful, and beauty is subjective, but much of Python’s popularity is a result of being so easy to work with."

Building a diesel train engine, on the other hand, is a complex problem that requires complex techniques.
