    "### What is Image segmentation?\n",
    "\n",
    "Image segmentation is the process of dividing a digital image into multiple segments (sets of pixels, also known as image objects). The goal of segmentation is to simplify and/or change the representation of an image into something that is more meaningful and easier to analyze. Image segmentation is typically used to locate objects and boundaries (lines, curves, etc.) in images.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Thresholding \n",
    "\n",
    "Thresholding is the simplest method of segmenting images. It is used to separate out regions of an image based on variation of intensity between object pixels and background pixels. From a grayscale image, thresholding can be used to create binary images\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Fixed Thresholding \n",
    "In this method we set one threshold value (global threhold value) for all pixels in the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Adaptive Thresholding \n",
    "It is the method where the threshold value is calculated for msaller regions and will have different threhold values for different regions."
